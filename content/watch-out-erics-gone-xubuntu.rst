Watch out Eric's gone Xubuntu

So I was installing Ubuntu onto my wife's puny laptop (400 mhz, 512 ram)
and I thought I'd try something different and install Kubuntu because
she complained that she didn't like Linux because it doesn't look like
XP.
I forgot how under powered her laptop was, Ubuntu ran fine on it before
she accidentally reformatted the drive by putting some forgotten Fedora
Core CD in it and kept clicking "OK", trying to make it go away, but
Kubuntu ran dog slow. It was bad, windows were tearing, drives were
swapping, it was a computing nightmare. I started googling, "How to
Replace Kubuntu with Ubuntu", and somehow I came across Xubuntu, which I
never gave the light of day because regular Ubuntu ran fine, and I was
unimpressed whenever I used XFCE.
On, this puny 400 mhz laptop, it runs pretty good, much better than
Gnome ran. So, when I got in to work today I decided to make the switch
to Xubuntu on my PC.
So I fired up VMWare (I run my linux install in VMWare because I can't
touch the internals of this PC) Ran, "sudo apt-get install
xubuntu-desktop", reboot and wala, XFCE in all it's glory!
In VMWare, Ubuntu(Gnome) didn't run super fast. It was useable, but
switching windows was a little laggy. XFCE, works beautifully (not
perfect, but a lot better).
I didn't really lose functionality, because a desktop environment is a
desktop environment, they all do pretty much the same thing. I'm not
sure I'm all that crazy with Thunar and the loss of gnome-vfs, but I can
make due.
So all and all I think switching to Xubuntu (Zoo-bun-tu?) is a great
Idea. Why would I not want run a resource intensive desktop environment
when I can have the same experience with a lighter desktop. Duh. Seems
like a no brainer...
Eric.
