One of the most respected and award-winning newspaper Web teams in the
world has moved to Florida and is looking for an experienced server-side
Web developer.

NDN Productions -- the online and new media publishing division of the
Naples Daily News -- is looking for a full-time Python programmer to
develop Internet-based applications that cross from computers to mobile
phones to iPods to Sony PSPs.

We strive for innovation and nimble development for sites that embrace
relational databases in ways they've rarely been used on the local level
coupled with broadband-centric multimedia content that all works
together in a platform-independent manner.

In other words, we strive to build the kinds of Web sites and related
offshoots that you wish were in your hometown.

We're big believers and contributors to the open-source community. Our
primary development platform is Python (mod\_python) and PostgreSQL,
with a particular emphasis on using the Django infrastructure.

That being said, we believe a solid background in Web application design
is more important than knowledge of a particular language or platform.
If you're a smart cookie and it shows, we know that you'll have no
problems picking up the tools we use.

We embrace a highly creative, non-traditional work environment. We love
to work fast and have fun, with the time between having a great idea and
that idea being added to one of our sites being measured in days, if not
hours.

Our salary is competitive, though not crazy huge, and our benefits
package is sweet.

And because our agile and autonomous online team works under the
umbrella of one of the largest and most stabile diversified media
companies in the nation, you don't have to worry about your checks ever
bouncing. If you work with us, your mom and dad will be proud, and your
friends will be envious.

So, if you learn things quickly, want to hang out with cool people and
build amazing Web content, than this is the place for you.

We're an equal-opportunity employer. In fact, we even hire folks from
Missouri.

So, contact Rob Curley at NDN Productions right now before one of your
buddies beats you to this great gig.
