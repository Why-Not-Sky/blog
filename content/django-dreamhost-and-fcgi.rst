There have been quite a few people in #django trying to get Django to
work with Dreamhost. Thanks to the work that Hugo has done and the folks
in the channel hacking away at the problem, the work has been posted on
the `Dreamhost wiki`_. Maybe now I can get Site5 to get django up and
running on my server.
