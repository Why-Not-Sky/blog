Phew,... I've been busy, I've finally gotten a breather to update my
blog. Two weeks ago we launched`http://www.bonitanews.com`_. It is the
first Ellington/Django site launched outside of World Online. We're very
proud of it.

Something else to be proud of, my son, `Aiden Jacob`_, was born on Sept.
8th. He is wonderfully healthy.

Life is good here in Naples, Florida. I think we've finally acclimated
to the Neapolitan lifestyle.

Be well.
