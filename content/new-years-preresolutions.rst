Ok, I'm not going call these resolutions, they just happen to be commitments I'm making on the first of the year :)

There are three of them, each corresponding to mind, body, and soul.

Mind
--------------
Read one book from the `Project Gutenberg <http://www.gutenberg.org/>`_ a month.  

Body
---------------
This one is two phased.  First I'm quitting smoking,  I've already started on the gum.  That's just a means to make the second one easier.  The second one is to exercise more often.  I think I'm going to start by running once a week.

Soul
---------------
Meditate at home once a week.  I already attend service at the local `Buddhist center <http://www.lslk.org/>`_ on Sundays which include a short meditation.  There just something about meditating in the privacy of your home that's makes it more fulfilling and intimate.

Ok, that's it.  Let's see if I stick to them.
