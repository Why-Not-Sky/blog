I've almost made it 4 days without a cigarette.  I'm pretty much off the nicotine gum, though I'm still carrying around a few pieces of gum in case of emergency.

I am currently reading "Flatland" by E. A. Abbott, it's an interesting book.

I haven't started exercising or the weekly meditation yet because my body is still recovering from the shock of not smoking anymore.  I anticipate starting that next week.  I plan on jogging Tuesday and Thursday and meditating on Wednesday.  We'll see how it goes, I'm not very eager to jog in the cold air.
