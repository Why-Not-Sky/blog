Remember back in the day when you could waste hours clicking on the net
finding information.Â It was fun, you felt like you were "surfing" the
net.Â Â I just finished reading my feeds on bloglines, going through the
links on digg.com, I even checked out slashdot to see artcles that I
read yesturday.Â Then I thought, now what.Â I don't know what to do
next.

With RSS, everything gets aggregated into a personality-less list of
articles.Â After I go through all the artcles, I find myself wondering
what to do next.Â Wtih all this new "web 2.0" technology, are we losing
the personality of the net?
