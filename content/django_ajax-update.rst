From the reaction of the folks in the django irc channel, it seems that
my Django\_Ajax library is a little advanced, everyone wants the power
of Ajax without having to write Javascript. I made the false assumption
that anyone messing with Ajax would know Javascript.

After taking a look at what Ruby on Rails does with their ajax api, I'm
going to be writting, with the help of some of the folks in #django, a
templatetag library to rival ROR's ajax helper functions. It should
shape up nicely this coming week.
