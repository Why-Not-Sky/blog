I saw this band on MTV the other day, `Coheed and Cambria`_. I'm really
digging their sound. It's like Rush if they decided to dive into 80's
hair metal. Many describe them as Emo Progressive rock. The lead singer
looks/sounds like the illegitimate son of the mother of the guy from
Counting Crows and the singer from Rush. Check them out.
