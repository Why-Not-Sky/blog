We saw Batman Begins in the theaters the day it came out and we both
thought it was the best batman movie ever. I don't know if my wife
thinks the movie was good because of the quality of the fact that her
boyfriend Christian Bale was batman. My only beef with the movie is the
Mr Bale's "Batman Voice" sounded really goofy.

Anyhow, while I traded in some games at gamestop yesturday and saw
"Batman Begins". I suspended my ban on movie games and picked it up. I
must say it was a good choice. The game is amazing. It was fun to play
and the graphics were simply amazing. The game wasn't hard but it wasn't
to easy that it was boring. I thought it was just plain fun.

The game plays off the concept of fear. You have a fear meter that you
can increase by doing scary things. For instance you can hang from a
light fixture and throw one of those HF emitters that summon bats to
scare the snot out of your enemies.

I beat it in about 4 hours or so. It's is not a long game, so I'd
recommend that you rent it. Gina even enjoyed watching me play it.

So, if you are in the mood for a fun game, pick up this one.
