`This is amazing`_, Nasa is smashing one of their space craft into the
comet Tempel 1 in hopes to see what is inside it.

I heard this on NPR this afternoon. They were interviewing a reporter
from `Sky and Telescope`_. Apparently if you live west of the
Mississippi River you will be able to see the impact on July 3rd at
around 10:53pm with your naked eye.

It's a shame I'm on the east coast :'( the comet will be under the
horizon when impact is to occur. It would of been a damn good excuse to
dust off my ol' Meade ETX-70.

All is not lost for us eastside geeks, however. The reporter at Sky and
Telescope said that we will be able to see the aftermath of the impact
on the Forth of July... yeah, ok, sure bud...

All sarcasm aside, the `Article`_ at Sky and Telescope gives westsiders
directions on how to locate the comet. For the eastside? There are also
links to several webcasts of the event at the end of the article.

`Keep Looking up!`_
