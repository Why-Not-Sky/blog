I bought a 128 meg usb drive from radio shack because it was on
clearance and fit on my keychain. I was trying to find reasons to use it
and I found, pam\_usb. PAM\_USB allows you to store a dsa key on your
usb drive that, when plugged in (it doesn't have to be mounted, just
plugged in). Despite a scary description on the page, it was pretty easy
to install.
