I was writing a friend of mine about some good Buddhist links and I
thought I might share them with whoever is reading this Blog.

`http://www.tubtenkunga.org`_ This is the website of the Buddhist Center
that I goto.

`http://www.thubtenchodron.org/`_ This is the website of a western nun
that writes a number of good books. Her site has a lot of resources

`http://www.lamayeshe.org/`_ This site has many free ebooks that you can
download.

`http://www.lamrim.com/`_ This website has a lot of great Buddhis
teachings by some the great Tibetan teachers and Western monks and nuns.
Some good Western teachers there are: Ven Sarah Thresher, Ven Thubten
Chodron, and Ven Robina Courtin (I really like her). Generally the
people who look Western would be the easiest to understand because they
put thinks in a Western context.
