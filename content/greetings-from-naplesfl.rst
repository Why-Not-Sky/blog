My wife and I are now in Naples, Fl. We are staying in a very nice
hotel. It's a Comfort Inn, but like everything I've seen of Naples, it's
very beautiful. It's the nicest Comfort Inn I've ever stayed in. I took
a few photos of the hotel room, I'll post those tommorrow. I want to
photograph the view from the window in the daylight. There are some
photos on our family blog, `http://www.themoritzfamily.com`_
