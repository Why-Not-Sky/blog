If they can produce meat in vitro? For vegitarians like myself that
don't eat meat because animals have to die, would I eat it? I don't
know.

It's an interesting quandery. I don't eat meat because mainly because of
the Buddhist belief that if we have had an infinate number of rebirths
then every being has once been our mother and that they are still our
mothers. Chewing on the flesh of my mother sounds absolutely discusting
to me.

So if muscle tissue can be produced in a lab, it's not technically flesh
and definately not the flesh of another living being. Is it any less
discusting? I doubt it.

I do eat veggie burgers which resemble meat, so I don't know what I
would think of eating something that is essentially flesh.

I'll just have to wait and form an oppinion when this stuff is in the
market.
