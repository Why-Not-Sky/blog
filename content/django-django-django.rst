This framework is so freakin' awesome.... They just enough documentation
on the site that you can actually get things running without much
effort.. I have to say, this is the coolest thing to come out in a long
time. You have a object-relational mapping system, obsessive SEO
support, a templating system and the coolest thing ever, automatic
administive interface! Oh not to mention it's freakin python! The best
scripting language ever. Go to `here`_ and check it out. NOW!
