I recently acquired a `Satechi's A2DP/Handsfree FM Carkit`_. What it
does is provide both a `A2DP`_ Bluetooth profile and a Handsfree profile
and transmits the bluetooth audio to your radio via FM. This was the
holy grail I've been looking for, streaming `shoutcast`_ to my car
stereo.

I don't have `3G`_ in Ft Myers, but in Miami this weekend I had all that
3G goodness to my disposal. I installed `TCPMP`_ on my Samsung Blackjack
and fired up some `EBM shoutcast streams`_ like `Bioindustral`_ or `Rant
Radio`_ and was cruising down`Biscayne Blvd`_ listening to some crazy
EBM/Sythpop, all streaming through the Internet on my phone!

I personally love that kind of music but I'm not going to devote a
library of MP3s to it. The music is so different from my normal
listening habits that putting my PMP on shuffle with EBM mixed in with
`"The Agency"`_ or `"Hot Water Music"`_, just wouldn't go. So I usually
get my EBM fix via shoutcast streams (It's great coding music).

So the A2DP functionality is absolutely great. No wires, nice crisp
stereo sound. It's just great. The hands free... It works but, not
great. I have to turn down my radio to avoid echoing, but it works well
enough to: pause my music, take a call and tell them "I'm driving, I'll
call back" and start my music up again (that process is automatic on my
Blackjack by the way, just press the answer button). Frankly I don't
want to talk when I'm listening to some good music, but that's just me.

The overall experience with this product is that it makes a great A2DP
to FM transmitter but a lousy hands free device. Fortunately I wanted it
for the A2DP and it works great, so I'm not that bummed about it. If you
want to send music from your phone to your stereo wirelessly, then this
is the one and only device for you.
