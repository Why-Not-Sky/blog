Now Running on Django
-----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks to this `post <http://forums.site5.com/showthread.php?t=10236>`_, I was able to get Django running on `Site5 <http://www.site5.com>`_

Just two days
-----------------------------------------------------------
Thanks to djangoprojects.com's blog application I was able to port my wordpress content to django and create some templates in just two days.  How do you like the new look?

django-diario
-------------------------------------------------------------
The next day I found `django-diario <http://code.google.com/p/django-diario/>`_ which is a simple blog application that seems to be actively developed.  I plan on following diario's tickets and sending some patches.  In fact I already sent one in.

Todo
------
I'd like to enable freecomments in diario for the time being.  I'll be looking into django-registration to add users so that I can do proper comments.
