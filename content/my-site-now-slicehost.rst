I just migrated my blog to slicehost because I finally got fed up with site5's janky django setup.  

I noticed that I broke my link to the django aggregrator when I moved my blog off wordpress and onto Django.  I tried to log into site5 to fix it and I got that damn "-bash: fork: Resource temporarily unavailable" error that prevents me from doing anything in my shell.  

I pulled my stuff off and stuck it on my slice.  I may get all kinds of errors, but we'll see.  Let me know if 
DNS is still propagating so you may not see this.
