Last night the wife and I had to go to the hospital because we both got
sick. We went to Memorial Pembroke(don't go there) and sat for four
hours. We ended up leaving and going to Memorial West(go there). We were
admitted immediatly.

At about 6am the doctor saw me. He diagnosed me with bronchitis. So, I'm
stuck at home again.
