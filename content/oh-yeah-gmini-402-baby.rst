My wife got me a GMINI 402 for Christmas. I wanted to wait a few weeks
before actually writing about my experience with it. My first expression
when I opened the box was that it was smaller than I thought it would
be. It is a very nice size. The case of the device is metal which makes
it feel really solid.

Audio

What is there to say, it's a mp3 player. It plays mp3s. I like the
ability to create playlists on the device. I can browse by artist and
press add and it adds all that artist's songs to the playlist.

This is were the device shines. I thought before I bought the device
that I would have to transcode all my videos to mp4's but after a few
weeks of use, I've noticed that I usually can just download the video
and dump it on the device as long as it's an avi encoded as divx with
mp3 audio which is proving to be the most common format I've found. The
only time I have to reencode the video is if it's a mp4 quicktime file
(which is what ipods/psps play). Being able to download and drop the
file into the device is really nice.

So far, I'm really impressed with the device.
