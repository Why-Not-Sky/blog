So after a day of mulling over GAE, I've come up with one conclusion.  For one-off apps, this is brilliant.  What Ruby and Rails did in it's heyday, this is going to do.  No need to figure out how to set up a web server or configure a database. Just write some python and blamo an application.

This also blows Facebook applications out of the water.  With GAE, you get a full web framework, written on top of a real language.  You aren't forced to use FBML, you can use Django templates.  Tie in opensocial and you have a turn-key application platform.

Now, I'm not sure that this is a viable solution to run a website on (what is a website anymore?), but writing a web application, it's brilliant.  Next up, Google Gears for appengine.
