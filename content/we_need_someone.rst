We need a Django Developer

There is now an opening at Naples Daily News for a new developer. If
anyone doesn't know what we're doing, let me fill you in.

If you do a search for "Rob Curley" in Google you will notice that it'll
take 38 pages of Google before people stop talking about him. He
previously worked for `World Online`_ and helped propel them into New
Media stardom.

Rob left Lawrence and has started making waves at Naples Daily News. It
is definitely the place to be if you want to win awards and become
famous.

`Poynter`_, which is the one of most prestigious journalism think tanks
in the country, this past month sent journalists to follow our work
during Hurricane Wilma because they wanted to see how `we worked`_. CBS
also sent their reporters to Naples to cover us for the `Early Show`_.
We have just started and we already have the world's attention.

I hope I'm not sounding pretentious but I'm very excited about the work
we've done and what we are going to do in the coming months. If there is
anyone out there that is interested in programming in Django full time
with one of the best New Media teams around, please let me know.
