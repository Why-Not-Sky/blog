I am sooo moving to Naples, it's so beautiful there. No really, I'm
moving to Naples August 13th.

I was in Naples this weekend interviewing for Naples Daily News. For
anyone that knows the history of Django, the code was developed at
`World Online`_. The man that was in charge at World Online was a fellow
named, `Rob Curley`_. Rob then `came down`_ to Naples with the intent to
kick ass, and that **we** will.

I'm the newest member of the Naple Daily News. My wife and I are moving
to a beautiful `apartment`_. The apartment complex' grounds looks like a
park. There is a huge lake, tons of trees, two tennis courts, two pools,
a fitness center and this is the best, access by water to the bay. I'm
thinking about getting a couple kayaks so that I can drop then in the
river from my apartment. That sounds like lots of fun.

Ok, so I have a new job working with `Django`_, the greatest thing for
web development since slice bread. Django is written in `Python`_, which
is the greatest thing for programming since slice bread. I'm working for
a New Media celebrity. I'm working with some of the best in the field.
I'm going to be living in a city were the local section of the newspaper
has to outsource to report about crime. I'm going to be living in an
apartment complex that is like looks like a park.

Someone, please do not pinch me.
