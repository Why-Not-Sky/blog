Overwelmed by Web 2.0

Prior to moving to Naples and taking the job at Naples Daily News, I was
kinda resisting the suite of "Web 2.0" technologies, Ajax, RSS,
Podcasting, etc.

Sure I tried RSS, and I thought it was cool but I guess I never had a
decent client to collect the feeds. I thought it was a little involved
to collect the RSS sources. Firefox made it easy with their fandangled
little rss icon but Live bookmarks never seemed like the right interface
for RSS. I tried out Thunderbird's RSS feature. Again, a little involved
to find the feeds. I noticed that a coworker, Levi, used Bloglines, and
that was nice. Then I found `litefeeds`_ which I really like primarily
for their cell phone interface. I'm starting to get a little overwelmed
by the shear volume of available RSS feeds. Which is good? So many, I
hardly have the time to find those I like...

On Friday I upgraded `Ubuntu`_ from Hoary Hedgehog to Breezy Badger...
Ok, oh my god, the best Linux distro eva'. Try it out, there's
`LiveCD's`_, no commitment needed.This isn't a post about Ubuntu, so let
me get back te the current topic. With the upgrade came the latest
version of `Amarok`_. No, this isn't that `annoying reality tv diva`_
from The Apprentise. This has to be the best audio player for Linux. If
you're using Linux, install this app. Even is you love Gnome and hate
KDE, install this app.

So, anyhow, with the newest version of Amarok, you get podcast support.
Another one of those "Web 2.0" technologies I never got into. So today I
got my first taste of podcasts. It was fun, it tasted good. I downloaded
our new `Bonita News.com`_ podcast and got to listen to Crunk Master Tim
sound all professional. I signed up to a few Buddhist themed podcasts,
the "Rock and Roll Geek" show, the "Keith and the Girl" podcast, so many
podcasts... Seems like anyone with a microphone has a podcast show. Who
has the time to listen to all those podcasts to become a fan of a few.

If anyone is actually reading this thing, please post a few comments
about your favorite podcasts, blogs, rss feeds, etc. You'd make my "Web
2.0 life" easier.
