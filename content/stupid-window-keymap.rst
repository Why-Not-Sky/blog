Stupid Windows Keymap

I've been using the standard windows keyboard layout switcher to remap
my keyboard to dvorak. Unfortunately when I log into a machine through
remote desktop, the keymap of the machine is used and not my local
keymap settings. This is really dumb because I annoy all my non-djorak
coworkers because when they log into the same machine, I usually forget
to switch the mapping back to qwerty and they get aoeu instead of
asdf...

I used a program called `keytweak`_ to remap my caplocks key to control,
which is very helpful because I use control much more than I use
capslock. I thought, "Hey, I can use keytweak to avoid annoying my
coworkers" it took some doing but I managed to remap all the keys. I
just feel sorry for the poor fellow that uses this computer if I ever
leave :)

Another cool utility for emacs users is the `XKeymacs`_ program that
sets emacs keybindings for stuff like moving the cursor and copy and
paste (kill and yank).
