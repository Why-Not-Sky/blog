The Django Virus

Well it looks like Django is going to be running in some high profile
places. With `Adrian's announcement`_ that he's going to be `working for
the Washington Post`_ soon and of course my announcement of me moving to
Naples to work for `Naples Daily News`_ and therefore Naples Daily New's
parent, media giant `Scripps`_. Django is going to have some really
impressive things to put on it's resume (take that Ruby on Rails j/k).
