Just another blog, *nothing to see here*...

Ok, well this is my adventure into the blogosphere. I'm not sure where
I'm going with this blog, but after creating my new `family's website`_
I was given unlimited subdomains and the ability to use `Fantastico`_ so
I had just had to create a personal blog.

My friend Jordon at `The World of Stuff`_, a fellow Esperantist (Saluton
Gxordono!) and Dvorak keyboad user, uses the blog software `Word
Press`_. I clicked a button in Fantasico and a moment later, *I had a
blog!*

Generally the blog will be my forum for showcasing stuff that I find
interesting. Stuff about My wife, Computers, Linux, Programming,
Buddhism, Jazz, Chess, Punk/Ska (alright, I thinks that's enough
keywords to make the search engine robots happy :) )

Well I hope you will enjoy my blog. I hope I enjoy it too :)
