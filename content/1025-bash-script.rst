10+2*5 bash script

I've been meaning to post this script for a while. It's a little bash
script that I wrote to switch xmms playlists using `Merlin Mann's
10+2\*5 procrastination hack`_. It's could well be the greatest bit of
code I've ever written.

I've been using it for weeks now, it works for me. It may work for you
or it may not. It's real simple, you can probably figure out how to fix
it if it doesn't work for you. Post a comment if it's broken on your
system.

The script itself: `tenplustwotimer.sh`_

A scripts that runs it in small xterm window: `tenplustwowin.sh`_

My two playlists, one EBM stream (for work), one Jazz stream (for
break): `tenplustwo\_pls.tar.gz`_

A quick tip, to change the playlist I usually just save over the ten.pls
or the two.pls and when the phase changes it'll load the new playlist.

What's great about using playlists instead of urls directly to the
stream is I can plug in my GMINI 402 and make two playlists from the
mp3s and
listen to my own stuff.
