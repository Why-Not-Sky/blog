Donating Bandwidth to Neighbors

My neighbors across the street don't have Internet access so I volunteered my WPA password to them so that they can use my Internet.  Today I decided to install a custom WRT54G firmware called `CoovaAP <http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaAP>`_ to turn my router into an open hotspot like you would see in hotels for my other neighbors to use.  

It was very easy to install and configure.  It uses `CoovaChilli <http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaChilli>`_ to create a captive portal to allow my neighbors create a user and log in.  It also separates my hardwired network from the wireless hotspot.

I also installed `ipp2p <http://www.ipp2p.org/>`_ to block p2p traffic to keep the bandwidth usage down.  Besides everyone uses p2p for piracy anyway (Don't try to deny it).  Bittorrent is a great technology used for evil.  Don't get me started on Limewire...  Here's a `howto <http://coova.org/wiki/index.php/CoovaAP/p2p_block>`_ on installing ipp2p on Coova
