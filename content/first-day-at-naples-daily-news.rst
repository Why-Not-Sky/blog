First Day at Naples Daily News

I had to return to Naples Daily News for a meeting with the Corporate
folks. I woke up in the morning to find that my wife didn't pack my
Khakis. So I was a little annoyed because I would be under dressed. My
wife drove me to the NDN IT building and while I was waiting for Rob
Curley (my boss) to arrive, I kept noticing that I was the only one
wearing jeans. I felt like it was my first day of high school, checking
out what everyone is wearing.

The meeting went well. I'm very excited about what is going to be
happening with Django and Ellington. What we are going to be doing with
the software is really going to show off the two systems.

I had the opportunity to meet `Jacob Kaplan-Moss`_, who is one of the
developers working on the Django project at World Online. He's a really
cool guy. He gave me an overview of their Ellington system, which blew
me away. The simplistic structure of this large system just showed me
why I knew that Django was an amazing framework.

Seeing Ellington in action proved to me that I have some big shoes to
fill. Well, it's a good thing I have large feet. Seriously, I'm
confidently that we're going to whoop some major ass with this stuff. I
wish I could go into more detail about what our intentions are but I'm
not sure what I'm allowed to say.
