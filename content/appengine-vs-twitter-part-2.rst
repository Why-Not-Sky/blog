I've created a project_ in launchpad for Meow_.  You can now submit bug reports and feature requests into launchpad.

If your a Django_ or Appengine_ hacker and want to help me out, simply branch the Meow code with bazaar and you can "bzr send" me patches.  I'll be happy to merge them if they're handy.

There is now a code link on the bottom of every Meow page to get you to the launchpad page.

Meow has also aquired the `Affero GPLv3`_ license as well to protect it's open source nature on the web.  The AGPLv3 requires modified source code to be made available even if it's running behind a web server.
